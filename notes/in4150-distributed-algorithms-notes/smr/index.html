      <div class="post-content">
        <p>The state of a machine is constituted by the contents of the data store (data written by the clients), and for redundancy might want to be replicated across multiple machines, such that if one fails another can immediately take over. In order for all machines to maintain the same state they have to implement <em>linearizability</em>, since they all need to execute the client requests in the exact same order.</p>
<h3 id="stopping-failure-tolerant-smr-algorithms">Stopping Failure Tolerant SMR Algorithms</h3>
<h4 id="lamports-single-value-paxos-consensus-algorithm">Lamport&rsquo;s Single-Value Paxos Consensus Algorithm</h4>
<p>The algorithm assumes only stopping failures (may restart later, mut no malicious or bugs(Byzantine fault)) and an asynchronous system. This is the single-value paxos, in which a group of processes agrees on a single value proposed by one of its participants, and there is also a multi-value paxos, where a group of processes decides on a sequence of values. Messages may be reordered, duplicated, or lost, but not corrupted. Votes can only be in favour or no vote at all (no message reply), but <strong>no</strong> voting against.</p>
<p>There are three types of processes,</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Proposers</em> that start with a value each that they may propose.</li>
<li><em>Acceptors</em> that accept and decide on a value (essentially voters)</li>
<li><em>Learners</em> that learn about the final outcome (essentially the servers)</li>
</ol>
<p>The algorithm runs in rounds, each with a sequence number, and only one proposer per round proposes its value (use a predefined list of which proposer does which round). A round has two phases.</p>
<p>Phase 1 where the proposer tries to build the majority without actually sending them the value, using <em>REQUEST_TO_PARTICIPATE</em> messages that are sent to some of the processes. When the acceptor receives the message and the round number is new, it sends a <em>PARTICIPATE</em> with its last vote and the round number of that last vote.</p>
<p>Phase 2 where the proposer selects the most recent vote (highest round number) with the majority and proposes the corresponding value of the vote with a <em>REQUEST_TO_VOTE</em> message. The proposer itself sends a message to the learner if it votes in favour (the learners receive all the votes and accept a value if at least one learner has received a value with the majority).</p>
<p>Variables that processes have are; <em>rnd</em> the highest round number it has participated in, <em>vrnd</em> the highest round number it has voted in, <em>vval</em> the value it has voted for in the highest round number, <em>prnd</em> is what the proposer maintains for the round number it initiated and <em>pval</em> for the value it is proposing.</p>
<p>This algorithm has livelock, which can be solved with an election algorithm for electing a leader that is the only one doing proposals.</p>
<h3 id="byzantine-fault-tolerant-smr-algorithms">Byzantine Fault Tolerant SMR Algorithms</h3>
<p>These algorithms work with signatures and hashing, and use the notion of <em>views</em> where each view has a <em>primary</em> replica and the remainders the the <em>backup</em> replicas. Views are numbered consecutively and the primary of a view $v$ is replica $p$ such that $p=v\text{ mod }n$ for $n$ total number of severs. Local data for replicas is the state machine, current view number, message log, and checkpoints of client requests that have been served. When all requests in a checkpoint are validated by all replica the checkpoint is called <em>stable</em>.</p>
<h4 id="castros-and-liskovs-practical-byzantine-fault-tolerance-pbft">Castro’s and Liskov’s Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)</h4>
<p>In each view one of the replicas acts as the <em>primary</em> and others are the backups. If a replica suspects a primary to be failing it will initiate a view change with $v+1$. Replicas broadcast their checkpoints in separate messages with a digest of the state and the number of the last request executed in it. When a replica received $2f+1$ matching checkpoint messages the checkpoint is <em>stable</em>, and previous checkpoints are deleted.</p>
<p>The operation of the algorithm consists of three phases,</p>
<ol>
<li>After a client sent a timestamped request to the primary the primary gives the request a sequence number and sends a <em>pre-prepare</em> message with the request, the view, and request number to all replicas. Replicas accept this message if it is in its current view and it has not accepted another <em>pre-prepare</em> message in the same view and request number.</li>
<li>Each replica then sends a <em>prepare</em> with the view and request number to all replicas (including themselves), and when a replica has received this and the corresponding <em>pre-prepare</em>, and at least $2f$ corresponding <em>prepare</em> messages it sends a <em>commit</em> message to all replicas.</li>
<li>When a replica received at least $2f+1$ <em>commit</em> messages (also counting its own) with the correct view and request number its local state reflects the execution of all previous requests. It then runs the request and replies to the client.</li>
</ol>
<p>A view change request from the backup (i.e. when it thinks the primary is faulty after some timeout and not receiving a <em>pre-prepare</em>) contains view number $v+1$ and the sequence number of the last stable checkpoint, the set of $2f+1$ messages that constituted the checkpoint, and for all request after the checkpoint for which it did the <em>pre-prepare</em> the corresponding <em>pre-prepare</em> and <em>prepare</em> messages, which is all broadcasted to all replicas. When the primary of the new view receives $2f$ of these view change messages it broadcasts a <em>new-view</em> message with the new view number, all <em>view-change</em> messages it received and <em>pre-prepare</em> messages for client request that may not have been executed. This way all replicas can sync up on the state of their checkpoint by retrieving missing information from other replicas (it knows its behind or ahead when comparing the sent data from the primary).</p>
<h4 id="kotla-et-als-speculative-byzantine-fault-tolerance-zyzzyva">Kotla et al.’s Speculative Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Zyzzyva)</h4>
<p>Again, the client sends its request to the primary which assigns it a sequence number and forwards it to all replicas (including self). Replicas immediately execute the request and reply to the client. If with no failures and fast replies a client receives $3f+1$ messages the request is considered done.</p>
<p>If there are failures or delays and the client receives less than $3f+1$ but at least $2f+1$ it sends a commit certificate to all replicas with proof that the majority of servers replied. When replicas receive the commit they respond with a local commit and when the client receives at least $2f+1$ such local-commit messages it considers the request done.</p>
<p>If the client receives less than $2f+1$ replies, it sends the request to all replicas who then expect the primary to still act on it. If the primary does nothing the replicas build a quorum of $f+1$ replicas that think the primary is failing by exchanging <em>I_hate-the-primary</em> messages, and once a replica receives $f+1$ such messages it sends a <em>view-change</em> to all replicas. When the new primary (are assigned in pre-defined circular order) gets $2f+1$ <em>view-change</em> messages it announces the new view with a broadcast.</p>
<h3 id="randomized-solutions">Randomized Solutions</h3>
<p>With random algorithms at some points one or more processes flip a coin to make progress towards a solution. These algorithms may always terminate but only have a correct result with some probability, or it may terminate with some probability but with a correct result, or it may only both terminate and produce a correct result with some probability.</p>
<h4 id="ben-ors-randomized-algorithm-for-consensus-in-synchronous-and-asynchronous-systems-with-crash-failures">Ben-Or’s Randomized Algorithm for Consensus in Synchronous and Asynchronous Systems with Crash Failures</h4>
<p>Every process has a binary input value $v$ and the number of faulty servers $f$ is $f&lt; n/2$. The algorithm runs in rounds $r$ with three phases</p>
<ol>
<li>The <em>notification</em> phase where messages contain the message type $N$</li>
<li>The <em>proposal</em> phase where messages contain the message type $P$</li>
<li>The <em>decision</em> phase.</li>
</ol>
<p>Processes wait for $n-f$ messages when they expect messages from all other processes.</p>
<p>The value $v$ is changed to $w$ (from the message with either a 0 or 1) after a single message was received and a decision on this value is made after more than $f$ messages with that value were received.</p>
<h4 id="ben-ors-randomized-algorithm-for-consensus-in-synchronous-and-asynchronous-systems-with-byzantine-failures">Ben-Or’s Randomized Algorithm for Consensus in Synchronous and Asynchronous Systems with Byzantine Failures</h4>
<p>This algorithm has a different decision procedure, in which the value of $v$ is only changed to $w$ (from the message which is either 0 or 1) when more than $f$ messages were received, and decision is then only made when more than $f$ messages with the same $w$ were received.</p>
