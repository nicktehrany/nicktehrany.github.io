When a process $P$ wants access to a resource $a$ from $R_a$, an edge is created from $P$ to $R_a$, and when the resource is granted, the edge is removed and replaced by an edge from $R_a$ to $P$ indicating that $R_a$ is waiting for $P$ to release the resource. If the WFG contains a cycle there exits a deadlock and all processes in cycles on paths leading to cycles are deadlocked.</p><p>In the <em>communication model</em> processes can do a blocking <em>RECEIVE</em> operation to a set of processes, indicating that they want to receive a message from one process in this set (called the <em>dependent set</em>). After this <em>RECEIVE</em> operation, the WFG contains an edge from $P$ to every process in its dependent set. If there exits a <em>knot</em> in the WFG, there is a deadlock. A knot is present if a set of processes with a path from every process in the set to every other process in the set exists, and there are no edges from any process in the set to any process outside the set.</p><p>In <em>N-out-of-M</em> requests a process sends a request to $M$ processes that can satisfy the request and it can proceed as soon as it has received $N$ <em>REPLY</em> messages (It may send a <em>RELINQUISH</em> to processes from which it has not received a <em>REPLY</em>). For static systems when $N=1$ this request is called OR-request, and when $N=M$ this request is called AND-request.</p><h3 id=chandy-misra-and-haas-deadlock-detection-for-and-resource-model-wfg-requests>Chandy, Misra, and Haas Deadlock Detection for AND (resource model WFG) Requests</h3><p>A process is said to be <em>dependant</em> if there is a path from it to some other process in the WFG. Processes maintain an array of dependencies <em>dep</em>, initially all set to false, and sets $dep_i(j)$ to true if $P_j$ knows $P_i$ is depending on it.</p><p>When a process suspects to be deadlocked, it sends a <em>PROBE</em> message to the processes it is waiting for. The <em>PROBE</em> messages are propagated by the receiver further through the system to the processes that the receiving process is waiting for. When the initiating process receives the <em>PROBE</em> message, a cycle is detected and it is deadlocked (the <em>PROBE</em> message is the form <em>probe(i,j,k)</em> with id <em>i</em>, initiating process <em>j</em>, and receiving process <em>k</em>).</p><h3 id=chandy-misra-and-haas-deadlock-detection-for-or-communication-model-requests>Chandy, Misra, and Haas Deadlock Detection for OR (communication model) Requests</h3><p>Every blocked process has a <em>dependent set</em> of processes that contains the process for which it is waiting to receive a message, and upon receiving a message from any process in the dependent set, it becomes active again.</p><p>When a process suspects to be deadlocked, it sends a <em>QUERY</em> to all processes in its dependant. Blocked processes will check the sequence number of the query, and if it has not seen it yet, propagate these messages to their dependent sets (generating a tree structure). Processes send a <em>REPLY</em> message back to their engager process (from whom they received the query), once they have received a <em>REPLY</em> from all the processes they themselves engaged (keep a counter of sent messages and received replies). A <em>REPLY</em> is only sent when the process is still blocked by the same query (it has not become active by getting a response from someone else, then there is no deadlock) A process is deadlocked if for every <em>QUERY</em> message it sent it receives a <em>REPLY</em>.</p><h3 id=bracha-and-toueg-deadlock-detection-for-static-systems-with-instantaneous-communication>Bracha and Toueg Deadlock Detection for Static Systems with Instantaneous Communication</h3><p>Every node $P$ maintains a set of <em>OUT</em> nodes $Q$ such that $(P,Q)$ is in $W$ (WFG) (the nodes to which P has sent a request but not received a reply from and also has not sent a relinquish to) and a set of <em>IN</em> nodes $Q$ such that $(Q,P)$ is in $W$ (opposite set of nodes as the other one, the nodes to which it should send a reply or receive a relinquish from). The algorithm has two phases, the <em>notify</em> phase where the spanning tree is created. When a node does not have any pending requests ($n=0$), it performs the <em>grant</em> procedure (send a reply to any request it receives) and sets its <em>free</em> variable to <strong>true</strong>. Sending of grants ends when a process has received a <em>REPLY</em> from every process in its <em>OUT</em> set. During the <em>simulate</em> phase, <em>GRANT</em> messages are used to simulate <em>REPLY</em> messages, and when a process receives enough <em>GRANT</em> messages, it becomes active again. If the initiating process has <em>free</em> set as <strong>false</strong>, it is deadlocked.</p><h3 id=bracha-and-toueg-deadlock-detection-for-static-systems-without-instantaneous-communication>Bracha and Toueg Deadlock Detection for Static Systems without Instantaneous Communication</h3><p>The problem with the previous algorithm is the assumption of instantaneous messages, in this algorithm messages can be in transit. Messages now have different colors</p><ul><li><em>gray</em>, if $P$ has sent a <em>REQUEST</em> to $Q$ which has not yet been received and $P$ has not sent a <em>RELINQUISH</em> to $Q$</li><li><em>black</em>, if $Q$ has received a <em>REQUEST</em> from $P$ but has not yet replied and $P$ has not sent a <em>RELINQUISH</em> to $Q$</li><li><em>white</em> if $Q$ has sent a <em>REPLY</em> to $P$ which has not yet been received and $P$ has not sent a <em>RELINQUISH</em> to $Q$</li><li><em>translucent</em>, if $P$ has sent a <em>RELINQUISH</em> to $Q$ which $Q$ has not yet received</li></ul><p>The algorithm is identical to the previous algorithm except the local sets <em>IN</em> and <em>OUT</em> now only contain black edges, and $n_v-$ #$graywhite_v$ is used instead of $n_v$.</p><p>At some point gray edges will become black, and white and translucent edges will disappear. We look at the total number of outgoing gray and white edges (#graywhite) and a node $v$ is active is $n_v\le$ #$graywhite_v$.</p><p>There may be a deadlock without detecting it, which means the algorithm has to be rerun to detect one.</p><p>Colors of edges are exchanged between messages by sending their <em>IN</em> and <em>OUT</em> sets to each other and comparing them to see the color (i.e. when $u$ is not in $IN_v$ and $v$ in $OUT_u$ the edge is gray or white).</p><h3 id=dynamic-systems>Dynamic Systems</h3><p>No static WFG graph of the system is available, but deadlock detection can be done by detecting a global state (e.g. with Chandy-Lamport) and then applying the algorithm for static systems with messages.</p><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']],displayMath:[['$$','$$'],['\\[','\\]']],processEscapes:true,processEnvironments:true},options:{skipHtmlTags:['script','noscript','style','textarea','pre']}};window.addEventListener('load',(event)=>{document.querySelectorAll("mjx-container").forEach(function(x){x.parentElement.classList+='has-jax'})});</script><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>1073 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2021-01-17</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://nicktehrany.github.io/notes/in4150-distributed-algorithms-notes/mutualexclusion/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
