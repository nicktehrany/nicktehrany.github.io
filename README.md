# My Website

A small website with all my current and previous projects and all other info on what I'm currently up to.
Notes for my different uni courses are also here, as well as my thesis work and future publications.

This is the hosting repo, therefore if anyone is curious about the actual code, that is in the [website](https://github.com/nicktehrany/website)
repo.

## Contributing

If you have changes/improvements/spelling fixes or just additions to my Uni notes, feel free to put in a pull request at [website](https://github.com/nicktehrany/website).
