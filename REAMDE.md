# My Website

A small website with all my current and previous projects and all other info on what I'm currently up to.
Notes for my different uni courses are also here, as well as my thesis work and future publications.

This is the hosting repo, therefere if anyone is curios about the actual code, that is in the [website](https://github.com/nicktehrany/website)
repo with a deploy script to build the website and push to this remote repo.
