There are many other projects like this, e.g. t which was the major inspiration for this project, however often these implementations are rather old and therefore require old python libraries for example. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to install an old python library just for this one application, I decided to implement a simple todo list manager in C since that will be on most systems by default.</description></item><item><title>mdtemp</title><link>https://nicktehrany.github.io/projects/completed-projects/mdtemp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nicktehrany.github.io/projects/completed-projects/mdtemp/</guid><description>I was tired of having to create new folder structure and latex files every time I had to create a new latex project (which was quite often).
