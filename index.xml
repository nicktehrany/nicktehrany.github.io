      <title>Lecture 5: Modern Stream Ciphers</title>

      <description>Modern Stream Ciphers (Chapter 12) Encrypt bits rather than blocks as this is faster and easier to implement in hardware and software. Stream ciphers work by
\[c=m\oplus F_k(0)\]
and are IND-PASS secure if the PRF is secure.
Feedback shift registers are a standard way of producing a binary stream of data. These consist of a number of memory cells, where some of them are tapped that feed a feedback function. Registers are shifted down and the result from the feedback is shifted to the empty cell.</description>

      <description>Security Games (Chapter 2.2) Security games are used to define security for cryptographic components, which contain an adversary and a challenger, and the idea is that the adversary needs to reach a certain objective given data provided by the challenger. These are typically represented visually with the adversary in a box and the challenger outside with the date it provides. The advantage of an adversary \(A\) is defined as a function bounded by time \(t\) that the adversary spends to try to solve the problem.</description>

      <description>Information Theoretic Security (Chapter 9) A crypto system is said to be computationally secure if the beset possible algorithm for breaking it requires \(N\) operations, where \(N\) is some large number above $2^{128}$. It is impossible to prove that a system is computationally secure, as we do not know if there is a better algorithm for breaking it, hence a system is called secure if the best known algorithm requires a large number of computations.</description>

      <description>Classical Systems (Chapter 7) An encryption algoithm or ciper is the transformation of plaintext to ciphertext with a secret key, depicted as
\[c=e_k(m)\]
with $m$ being the plaintext,
$e$ being the cipher function,
$k$ being the secret key,
$c$ being the ciphertext
The reverse process is called decryption or decipherment, depicted as
\[m=d_k(c)\]
The key above needs to be known to both parties, but must be kept secret from all others.</description>

      <description>What is Security? Security means:
Confidentiality: Access to systems or dataa is limited to authorised parties.
Integrity: WHen you receive data, you get the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; data.
Availability: The system or data is there when you want it.
Objectives of Cryptography - Message authentication: valid message? - Data origin authentication: valid sender? - Enitity authentication: authenticate each other for communication  Kerkhoff&#39;s principle: The adversary knows all details about the crypto system except the private key.</description>

      <description>I was tired of having to create new folder structure and latex files every time I had to create a new latex project (which was quite often). Therefore I made a quick and simple command to set up the basic directory structure and initialize the .tex files with the most basic necessities.
Setup Clone the repo anywhere you like,
git clone https://github.com/nicktehrany/textemp  Source the textemp script in your .</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Evaluating Performance Characteristics of the PMDK Persistent Memory Software Stack&amp;rdquo; Abstract: Society nowadays revolves more and more around data. Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence depend on large amounts of data to conduct research, and train machine learning models and agents. With the ever increasing amount of data, comes the need for faster storage. The quest for new storage devices has resulted in the development of non-volatile memories, that run alongside conventional memory and are directly accessible by the CPU, with large capacity of persistent storage.</description>

      <description>My dotfiles repository, which is more of a continuous project likely to never be done, for managing all my config files for vim, zsh, tmux, git, other dotfiles and utilities I use.
Installation git clone https://github.com/nicktehrany/dotfiles cd dotfiles sudo ./install  Check the .travis.yml for packages that will be installed, if not already installed. All existing links or config files will be overwritten! (Check .install.conf.yaml for all links)</description>
