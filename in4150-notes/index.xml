      <description>Time has an important role in computer systems, the applications that they run need to be able to keep track of time and events and compare timestamps. In asynchronous systems it may be necessary to reason about events based on their order of occurrence.
Happened-Before Relation The basis of the theory of ordering events in distributed systems is the happened-before relation, and is given as $\rightarrow$ as the following
 Local Order: If $a,b\in E_i$ for $i$ and $a$ occurred in $P_i$ before $b$ then $a\rightarrow b$.</description>

      <title>Modeling Distributed Systems</title>

      <description>DSs and DAs are modelled with a set of processors or processes, which do local computations and send and receive messages, and are connected by unidirectional communication channels, and networks are assumed to be connected such that there is a path from every process to every other process.
In a complete network there is a link from every processor to every other processor. In ring every processor is connected to two other processors.</description>

      <description>What is a Distributed System? Distributed computer systems are collections of computer systems that present themselves as single entities to their users and are characterized by
 Autonomy: The components of the DS have a certain power or authority to make their own decisions. Cooperation: The components iof a DS are working together towards common goals. Communication: The components of the DS exchange information.  Properties of Distributed Systems  There is no regular structure such that a DS may be connected by heterogenous network technologies and consist of many different processors.</description>
